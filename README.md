##  "You did send me back to the future.  But now I'm back from the future."

Retro Journal brings back the simplicity of early computing. In a world of constant notifications, pop-ups, and complex formatting bars, Retro Journal offers a sanctuary. 

It’s just you, your thoughts, and the comforting glow of a CRT monitor (or the crisp stillness of e-ink).

##  Features

* ** Distraction-Free:** No notifications, no social media integrations, no clutter.
* ** Local First:** There is no uploading.  Your data never leaves your machine. 
* ** Flexible Saving:** Export your work as `.txt`, `.md`, `.doc`, or `.odt`.
* ** Focus Mode:** Typewriter scrolling keeps your current line centered.
* ** Cross-Platform:** This is an Electron app, so it can be downloaded for Windows, Mac, and Linux.
